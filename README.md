## Project Overview

### What and Why?
Living with roommates comes with everyday challenges that create unnecessary friction:
- Whose turn is it to take out the trash?
- Who owes money for utilities and groceries?
- Who finished the milk without buying more?
- Why is it so loud when someone is trying to sleep?

RoomieHub solves these problems by offering a centralized hub where roommates can coordinate chores, split expenses, track shared items, and maintain group harmony through anonymous feedback systems.
